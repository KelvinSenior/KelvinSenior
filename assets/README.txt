Place a professional headshot at `assets/headshot.jpg` (recommended: 600x600, JPG/PNG).

Create a `photos` folder and add the six provided photos with these filenames:

- `assets/photos/photo1.jpg`
- `assets/photos/photo2.jpg`
- `assets/photos/photo3.jpg`
- `assets/photos/photo4.jpg`
- `assets/photos/photo5.jpg`
- `assets/photos/photo6.jpg`

Also copy the original resume PDF `SKS Professional-CV-1.pdf` into the project root so "Download CV" works.
